# Socket-chatApp_Server
Server script for Socket chat app(Android). Simple realtime group chat app.
Made as a part of learning Socket.io library for node.js and implementing socket.io java client.

- `git clone <repo-url>` into a directory, or download the zip and extract.
- open terminal and cd into the directory
- `npm install`
- In index.js file, look for `<your-ip-here>` and replace it with your local ip
- In the ChatApp.java file of the android app, replace the `<your-ip-here>` in the CHAT_URL variable with the same local ip
- Now run the node app
    `node index.js`
- Run the android app on your phone
